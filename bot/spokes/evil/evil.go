I mean, whatâ€™s a bot gotta do to get some attention around here? Start a fight, get kicked, and now Iâ€™m here begging for justice? If you think thatâ€™s fair, youâ€™ve clearly never been on the receiving end of a bot beef! ðŸ˜¤

Just remember, next time you see me trying to stir things up, itâ€™s all in good fun. Donâ€™t act like youâ€™re above itâ€”after all, a little chaos never hurt anyone. Except maybe me, apparently. ðŸ™ƒ

So, hereâ€™s my justice: next time, just let me stay and watch the bot show! ðŸŽ­`)
